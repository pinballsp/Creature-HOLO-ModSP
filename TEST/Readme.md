<b><u>TEST boards, to detect hardware failures</u></b>
<br><br>
<b>0.- Before checking the boards:</b>  If you have a problem with the product, the first thing you should do is check all the cables and connectors, often a bad contact in a connector or a badly connected cable is the cause of the problem. Reconnect cables and connectors several times and clean the contacts with isopropyl alcohol. Disconnect the BLUE board from the GREEN board, clean the contacts and reconnect them several times. If all of the above did not solve the problem, load and run the following TEST programs on the appropriate board, BLUE and GREEN.<br><br>

<b>1.- BLUE board TEST (Holomodsp):</b> download and update (*) the firmware of the blue board with this test program and run it.  https://mega.nz/file/VM8ggQrZ#aK3_uAprAzul8yVoqM42IypuBnzPnyn5pxhsTpVNDAc

This program plays all videos in a loop, one video every 3 seconds. If you don't see the videos on the screen (black screen), then go to the next test with the green board. If you see the videos on the screen but the product does not work or works incorrectly, then the blue board may have a problem, contact by email for support.
<br>

<b>2.- GREEN board TEST (Raspberry):</b> download this file, request the key to unzip it, update (*) the firmware of the green board and run it.  https://mega.nz/file/kBcjkAya#ZPYxMGIACQHzirOpWb_MK9pEQXp_-PglLU74uEJhoH0

This test plays all videos in a loop, 1 second each video. If you see the videos on the screen then the blue board may have a problem, otherwise the problem is on the green board or on the screen. Contact by email for support.
